# 'Cracking the Coding Interview' Solutions

Here you'll find solutions to problems from the Cracking the Coding Interview book.  They should all be optimal in terms of asymptotic complexity.  I'm making these available for students who want to compare to their own solutions, as well as people who would like to read alternate solutions (the CTCI book includes its own solutions).  Problems are organized by chapter.  Comments, suggestions, and corrections are always welcome!
