# Cracking the Coding Interview - Solutions

Here you'll find solutions to problems from the Cracking the Coding Interview book.  Most of them should be optimal in terms of asymptotic time complexity and/or space complexity.  I'm making these available for students who want to compare to their own solutions, as well as people who would like to read alternate solutions (the CTCI book includes its own solutions).  Problems are organized by chapter.  For many problems I've included a few paragraphs indicating a general thought process and possible avenues for improvement.  Comments, suggestions, and corrections are always welcome!
